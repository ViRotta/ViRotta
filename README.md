# Hi, I'm Vitória 👋
**Computer Engineering • Full-Stack (React + FastAPI) • Cloud track • Embedded/IoT (north star) • Applied AI**

I build end-to-end products (frontend + backend + deployment). Right now I’m focused on **Full-Stack + Cloud**, while evolving toward **Embedded/IoT** solutions powered by **applied AI**.

## 🚀 What I’m doing now
- Shipping **Full-Stack** features with clean APIs and practical deployment
- Studying **Cloud** fundamentals and infrastructure patterns used in real products
- Keeping my long-term focus on **Embedded/IoT** (ESP32 / Embedded Linux)

## ⭐ Featured project
- **FinanceMail** — Email classifier + suggested reply  
  **Stack:** React (Vite) • FastAPI (Pydantic) • scikit-learn (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression) • LLaMA 3 8B Instruct  
  Repo: https://github.com/ViRotta/FinanceMail

## 🧩 Tech
**Frontend:** React, Vite, JavaScript  
**Backend:** Python, FastAPI, Pydantic  
**Data/ML:** scikit-learn, TF-IDF, Logistic Regression, applied LLMs  
**Embedded/IoT:** C/C++, ESP32, Arduino, Embedded Linux  
**Infra:** Linux, Docker, Render (Static Site + Web Service)

## 🎯 Goal
Full-Stack / Cloud roles where I can ship product — building toward **Embedded/IoT systems with AI**.

☕ Fun: coffee/tea/chimarrão while studying.
